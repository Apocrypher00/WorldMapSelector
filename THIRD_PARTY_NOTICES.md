# Third-Party Notices

WorldMapSelector-authored source is released under the Unlicense. The combined
plugin binary is governed by GPL-3.0-or-later with CommonLibSSE NG's exceptions.
See `LICENSING.md` for that distinction. Neither grant replaces the licenses of
other third-party projects used to build or run WorldMapSelector.

The exact dependency revisions used by a build are pinned by `vcpkg.json`, its
builtin baseline, and the CommonLibSSE NG Git submodule commit.

## License terms

The complete GPL text and exceptions for CommonLibSSE NG are present in its
checked-in Git submodule at `extern/CommonLibVR/COPYING` and
`extern/CommonLibVR/EXCEPTIONS.md`. Exact license texts for vcpkg
dependencies are installed under each package's `share/<package>/copyright`
path during the build.

Binary distributions must be accompanied by the applicable copyright and
license texts for linked third-party components. In particular, the MinHook
and BSD-licensed components require their notices and disclaimers to accompany
binary redistributions.

For a public mod archive, consolidate those required texts into a
WorldMapSelector-specific notice file beneath
`SKSE/Plugins/WorldMapSelector/`. Do not place generic files such as
`LICENSE`, `COPYING`, or `README` at the archive root: mod managers treat the
archive as a `Data`-directory payload, and generic names can collide with files
from unrelated mods. This repository's summary is not a replacement for the
complete license texts that must accompany the binary release.

Build tools such as CMake, Ninja, vcpkg, Git, and Microsoft Visual C++ are not
redistributed as part of WorldMapSelector.
